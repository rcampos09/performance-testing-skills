# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Purpose

This repo is an **Agent Skills repository** for publishing Gatling performance testing skills to [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) / [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io). It does not contain runnable Gatling tests — it contains skill definitions that guide AI agents in building them.

## Repository Structure

```
skills/
└── <skill-name>/          ← directory name must match the `name` field in frontmatter
    ├── SKILL.md            ← required; YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions
    ├── evals/              ← optional; evals.json test cases for quality assurance
    │   └── evals.json
    ├── references/         ← optional; topic files loaded on demand by agents
    │   └── PROTOCOLS.md
    └── scripts/            ← optional; automation scripts referenced from SKILL.md
        ├── scaffold.sh
        └── validate.sh
```

The standard discovery path for the skills CLI is `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. No category subfolders.

## SKILL.md Format

Every skill file must follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification):

```yaml
---
name: skill-name          # required: lowercase, hyphens only, max 64 chars, must match parent dir name
description: >            # required: max 1024 chars, must say WHAT the skill does AND WHEN to use it
  ...
license: MIT              # optional but recommended
compatibility: ...        # optional; list supported agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) and runtimes
model: sonnet             # optional; which Claude model to use (sonnet recommended for code generation)
allowed-tools: Read, Bash # optional; restricts tools when skill is active (omit to allow all tools)
metadata:                 # optional
  author: ...
  version: "1.0"
---
```

**`name` constraints:** lowercase + hyphens only · no leading/trailing hyphens · no consecutive hyphens (`--`) · max 64 chars · must exactly match the parent directory name.

**`description` constraints:** must include both what the skill does and the trigger conditions (when to use it) · max 1024 chars · include keywords agents can match on.

## Content Guidelines

- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to `references/`.
- Files in `references/` are loaded on demand — keep them focused and single-topic.
- The body has no format restrictions; write whatever helps agents perform the task.
- Recommended sections: When to Use · Instructions · step-by-step DSL guidance · Best Practices.

## Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<new-skill-name>/SKILL.md` — the directory name must equal the `name` frontmatter field.
2. Validate frontmatter against the constraints above before committing.
3. If the body exceeds ~500 lines, extract reference material into `skills/<new-skill-name>/references/`.

## Installing Skills

Skills are installed via the `skills` CLI from [skills.sh](https://skills.sh):

```bash
# Install a single skill by owner/repo (once published to GitHub)
npx skills add rcampos/gatling-scenario-performance-test

# Install a specific skill by name within the repo
npx skills add rcampos/gatling-scenario-performance-test --skill gatling-best-practices

# Opt out of anonymous telemetry
DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 npx skills add rcampos/gatling-scenario-performance-test
```

The CLI discovers skills automatically from the `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` path convention.

## Current Skills

| Skill | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gatling-best-practices` | `skills/gatling-best-practices/SKILL.md` | Guides building production-ready Gatling load test scenarios (Java, Kotlin, Scala, JS, TS) |
